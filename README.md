# iMC-Code
This repository holds extensions for HP's excellent iMC Network Management software.  It contains adapters that I have created for use with devices that exist in environments that I work on.  I have grouped it into the same folders that are accepted by HP's Configuration Management module, to use you can simply download the folder structure as is and drop it into your HP iMC installation and restart the iMC server.

# Warranty
